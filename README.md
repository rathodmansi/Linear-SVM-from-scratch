# Linear-SVM-from-scratch

The aim is to built my own linear support vector machine with hubrized hinge loss from scratch in python.

Key Concepts tested:
- Calculating the gradient descent algorithm using calculus and differentiation
- Defining the objective and gradient descent function
- Writing fast gradient algorithm, misclassification error, specificity and sensitivity
- Check out the model performance with different values of lambda (regularisation parameter)
